After downloading it, you must install the plugin in the QGIS plugins folder, located under your user profile in: .qgis2/python/plugins. Simply unzip the KPOpilot.zip file and move the folder into this folder, then start QGIS and load the plugin ‘KPO pilot’ from the ‘Plugins Manager’ window.

The plugin is self-contained and does not require any additional download or configuration. To start the plugin simply click the toolbar button or ‘KPO datasysteem pilot’ entry in the ‘Plugins’ menu.

When the plugin starts, it automatically loads the data system and the user interface provided to interact and explore the data.
